💡 Key Analytical Insights

1️⃣ Customer Retention by Segment
Certain customer segments demonstrate significantly higher retention, indicating strong loyalty and repeat engagement.

2️⃣ Churn Analysis
Churn is notably higher among low-frequency buyers, highlighting the need for targeted engagement and reactivation strategies rather than blanket promotions.

3️⃣ Repeat Purchase Trends
Customers enrolled in loyalty programs show higher repeat purchase frequency, reinforcing the importance of loyalty-driven retention.

4️⃣ Revenue Contribution by Customer Type
A relatively small group of loyal customers contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue, emphasizing the value of retaining high-tier customers.

5️⃣ Store & Region Insights
Specific regions (notably Liverpool and Birmingham) exhibit higher churn rates, while store maturity and localized engagement play a key role in retention performance.
